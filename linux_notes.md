Adding Linux basic commands
### This repo is a summary of Unix and commands used to manouver within Unix/Linux Environment

```

ls - lists content of a directory. 
      This could be current, previous or subseqeunt directories. 
      Depending with the type of file,listing displays them differently. This command can be combined with multiple options to      provide much information about the files within a directory

pwd - prints path to your working directory.

cd - used to move from one directory to the other.  Important to keep in mind the use of slash "/" sign.
     This command can always be combined with '..' "two dots" which allows one to change directory relative to the current          directory. Absolute and relative paths provide a quick way to change directories. The 'ls' commandncan be combinied with 
     '..' to list contents of parent directories.

mkdir - used to create directories. 

man - This command provides short documentation manual regarding the usage of particular command. This performs same function w     '--help' command althoug they use different interfaces.

rmdir - removes a empty directory.

touch- command used to create empty files

mv - used to move files from one directory to another. The usage includes providing name of file to be moved and the          directory to where it will be moved. 'mv' can also be used to rename files.

rm - a command to be used with caution. Used to remove files, rather completely delete files. This can be combined with '-i' whic prompts to authorize the deletion of a file.

cp - used to copy files from one location to the other. cp combined with '-r' can be used to copy directories too.

less - used to view contents of a file

cat - used to display contents of a file, whose functionality is different from 'less'. Unlike less, teh use of cat limits          control over the displayed content. This command is also used to join(concatinate) multiple files into one.

wc - used to count characters in a file or directory.

Nano  - used to edit files within the terminal. It assumes role of texteditor in the terminal.

grep - command utilized to identify patterns in files. 

cut - command that used to handle files with columns. Column numbers can be specified and extracted using this command.

|  - pipe used to intergrate functions of two or more commands. Placing it between commands passes execusions of the previous command to the later.

Several other useful unix commands including 'tail, head, sed' are use to handle files.

## tada!
